# Progress log

Append one entry per thread, newest at the top. Keep each entry short:
what changed, how it was verified, what was not verified, and what comes next.
Earlier history is in `docs/optimisation-progress.md` and the dated docs.

## 2026-10-20 — TOOL-1: make browser checks runnable

- Added `playwright` 1.56.1 as a root dev dependency, pinned exactly because
  its Chromium (revision 1194) is the one preinstalled in cloud sessions.
  Playwright has no install script, so `npm ci` downloads no browsers.
- Updated `scripts/verify-engineer-layout.mjs` for UI changes since September:
  the home heading is now the engineer's name, report sections are now cards
  with a kind picker, links carry a return path, and the removed "Team &
  contacts" and "Trade affected · Coming soon" checks are replaced by the
  disabled "Assigned to me" button and the defect card's default trade.
- CLAUDE.md now gives the exact commands.
- Verified in a cloud thread on Node 24 after `npm ci`, `npm run typecheck`,
  `npm test` (48 web tests) and `npm run build`: `verify-role-access` passed
  (61 checks) and `verify-engineer-layout` passed. `npm ci` without
  `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD` left no `~/.cache/ms-playwright`.
- Not passing: `verify-pdf-navigation`. The in-app PDF viewer shows
  "this[#ne].getOrInsertComputed is not a function": pdfjs-dist 6.3 uses
  `Map.prototype.getOrInsertComputed`, which Chromium 141 lacks. This is a
  real fault for anyone on an older browser (likely older iPhones too), not a
  check problem. Not verified on a real phone.
- Not done: browser checks are not in CI (CI changes were left alone).
- Next: fix the PDF viewer on older browsers (pin pdfjs-dist to a version
  without the new Map method, or polyfill it in page and worker), then FE-3a.

## 2026-10-20 — FE-4c: PM acknowledgement test

- Closed the test gap on PM acknowledgement in `apps/web/tests/corrections.test.ts`.
  The tests now check that acknowledgement stores who, when and an optional
  trimmed note (a blank note is not stored), that it leaves receipt time,
  review, PDF delivery and the report's issue untouched, that approval and
  issue closure do not count as acknowledgement, that the first one stands,
  and that the status words for each fact stay separate.
- No application code changed: the behaviour was already built. A mutation
  check (making acknowledgement also approve) made the new test fail.
- Verified: `npm run typecheck` and `npm test` pass (web suite 49 tests).
- Not verified: no browser check (the task has none, and Playwright is TOOL-1);
  the office "Read" row was read in code, not seen in a browser.
- Next: FE-3a (signatures across reloads) once the editor lane is free.

## 2026-10-20 — Set up the autonomous development loop

- Added `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/tasks.json` (19 tasks from the approved backlog),
  this log, a `reviewer` subagent, a Stop hook that runs typecheck and tests
  when code changed, a SessionStart hook that installs dependencies, and CI.
- Verified: `npm run typecheck` and `npm test` pass locally (Node 22 in the
  cloud sandbox); the hook scripts were exercised with and without code changes.
- Not verified: CI on GitHub until this PR runs; Node 24 in cloud threads
  (the project's cloud environment still needs it).
- AUDIT-1 done (read-only): each task's notes now say what exists, with file
  paths. Nothing meets its acceptance in full; FE-4c needs only a test, and
  FE-1a, FE-5b and FE-6b are mostly built.
- Added the master plan to `docs/tasks.json`: order, lanes (file areas that
  must not be worked on by two threads at once), dependencies, and a limit of
  two active threads. Added TOOL-1 because no browser check can run until
  Playwright is installed.
- Next: TOOL-1, then FE-4c, FE-3a, FE-4a.
